# Diary

This sample is built with Jetpack Compose, the new UI framework in Android.

## Getting Started

To learn how to load apps on the Surface Duo emulator, see the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/dual-screen/android), and follow [the blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/surface-duo).

## Features

When the app is in dual mode, both the Calendar View and the Editor will be spread out on two separate screens. If the user is in portrait mode, the app will give you the ability to toggle between calendar view and the editor 

The sample uses the [Companion Pane](https://docs.microsoft.com/dual-screen/introduction#companion-pane) app pattern to show a Calendar view + Diary on One Screen , and the diary editor box for the selected day on the other pane.


## Single Screen Mode

In single screen mode, users are able to view one of two screens at a time: Diary Writer or Calendar with Content for the day. A button appears in the Calendar window and the editor that can be used to toggle between the two screens

## Dual Screen Mode

In dual screen mode, both windows are visible, so no buttons are visible to enable toggle.
