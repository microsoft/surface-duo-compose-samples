# Surface Duo Jetpack Compose samples

This repo contains the samples built in Jetpack Compose for Microsoft Surface Duo. These samples demonstrate [user interface patterns](https://docs.microsoft.com/dual-screen/introduction#dual-screen-app-patterns) with the new UI framework.

## Getting Started

When importing the code samples into Android Studio, use the **ComposeSamples** folder as the base directory of the project. This lets you access and run all of the samples from within the same project.

## Prerequisites

- Jetpack Compose version: `1.0.4`

- AndroidX WindowManager version: `1.0.0-beta02`
